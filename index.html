        <h4>my story</h4>

       <p> <b>Among all the creatures on Earth , human being is definitely <u>superior</u>.
             Writing a few lines or words about myself to introduce, 
             I feel myself to be tiny part of this entire world that is filled with the human beings around.
              I am a human. I myself am humble, kind, caring and courageous. I am most respected, loved and responsible human being. 
              Though, it is quite hard to write about yourself yet I have tried myself best to express all about myself.
       </b></p>
    <p>I am the <b>youngest</b>of my only brother and two sisters. 
        My <u>elder brother</u> is just six years elder in age than me. 
        My other two elder sisters are younger than my brother. 
        Being the eldest one, sometimes, gives you the favors. 
        Luckily, <b>I am loved</b>, cared and most favored upon in my all family.
