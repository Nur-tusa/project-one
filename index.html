   <b> <u>Baobab trees</u> grow in 32 African countries. They can live for up to 5,000 years, 
    reach up to 30 metres high and up to an enormous 50 metres in circumference. 
    Baobab trees can provide shelter, food and water for animals and humans, 
    which is why many savannah communities have made their homes near Baobab trees.</b>

 <p>The common fig tree is a species of flowering plant that is native to the Mediterranean and western Asia.
      It is part of the mulberry family, and has been naturalized in North America as well. 
      They prefer to grow in deep and moist soil, 
     though they have been known to grow in rocky dry locations as well</p>

 <p>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, 
     supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, 
     the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only wood plants with secondary growth,
      plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height</p>

 <p>Beech (Fagus) is a genus of deciduous trees in the family Fagaceae, 
     native to temperate Europe, Asia and North America. Recent classifications recognize 10 to 13 species in two distinct subgenera, 
     Engleriana and Fagus. The Engleriana subgenus is found only in East Asia, 
     distinctive for their low branches, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark. 
     The better known Fagus subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark. 
     The European beech (Fagus sylvatica) is the most commonly cultivated.

 we all know about pine cones!></p>
