        <h4>my story</h4>

       <p> <b>Among all the creatures on Earth, human being is definitely <u>superior</u>.
             Writing a few lines or words about myself to introduce, 
             I feel myself to be tiny part of this entire world that is filled with the human beings around.
              I am a human. I myself am humble, kind, caring and courageous. I am most respected, loved and responsible human being. 
              Though, it is quite hard to write about yourself yet I have tried myself best to express all about myself.
       </b></p>
    <p>I am the <b>youngest</b>of my only brother and two sisters. 
        My elder brother is just six years elder in age than me. 
        My other two elder sisters are younger than my brother. 
        Being the eldest one, sometimes, gives you the favors. 
        Luckily, I am loved, cared and most favored upon in my all family.
